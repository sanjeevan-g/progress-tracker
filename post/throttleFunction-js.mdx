## Throttling in javascript

throttle is used to limit the number of times a function is called, but, unlike debounce, throttle will call the function passed to it every time the delay ends as long as the trigger for the function is still happening.

## Advantages

1. optimize the website
2. avoid continues api calls to server
3. on multiple concurrent calls, it will execute atmost once after every given delay

## types of Throttling

1. based on count

   - will execute the function only after calling given count times

2. based on delay

   - will execute at first then after delay, inbetween calls are ignored

3. based on options
   - leading - normal Throttling with delay (first call and after delay)
   - trailing - will not execute immediately only after the delay time, will also involke on last call after delay
   - both - will call at first and after delay and at last call after delay

## initial setup

```js
<button id="btn">click!</button>;
let btn = document.getElementById("btn");

const onClick = () => {
  console.log("clicked !!", Date.now());
};
btn.addEventListener("click", throttleFn);
```

## based on count

```js
const throttle = (fn, count) => {
  let callCounter = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    if (++callCounter !== count) return; // not to work

    // else
    callCounter = 0; // reset call counter
    fn.apply(this, args);
  };
};

const throttleFn = throttle(onClick, 3); // based on count, run function on count*i clicks, i = 1,2,3..
```

## based on delay

```js
const throttle = (fn, delay) => {
  let shouldWait = false; // true when function is in throttle mode

  return function (...args) {
    if (shouldWait) {
      return;
    }

    fn.apply(this, args);
    shouldWait = true; // executed fn now wait for delay time
    setTimeout(() => {
      shouldWait = false;
    }, delay);
  };
};

const throttleFn = throttle(onClick, 1000); // will work on 0 , 1sec, 2sec ...
// issues => inbetween fn calls are ignored and last fn call is also ignored
```

## with options

```js
// 3. delay with options
// leading -> normal throttle fn, work at first and then after delay time
// trailing -> work after the end of delay time, work at last call after delay

const throttle = (fn, delay, options) => {
  let shouldWait = false; // true when function is in throttle mode
  let lastArgs; // holds the arguments of last call

  const { leading, trailing } = options;

  const timeoutFunc = () => {
    if (lastArgs && trailing) {
      // last args and in trailing mode
      fn.apply(this, lastArgs);
      lastArgs = null;
      setTimeout(() => timeoutFunc(), delay);
    } else {
      shouldWait = false; // default mode
    }
  };

  return function (...args) {
    if (shouldWait) {
      lastArgs = args; // update last args with current arguments
      return;
    }

    fn(...args);
    shouldWait = true; // executed fn now wait for delay time
    setTimeout(() => timeoutFunc(), delay);
  };
};

const throttleFn = throttle(onClick, 1000, {
  leading: true,
  trailing: false,
});
```
