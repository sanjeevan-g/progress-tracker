usePopCorn udemy project used to search for movies from api and able to add rating to those movies and add them to our watchlist

## useState
- useState hook also accepts callback fn as an argument
- if we need any computation to be done to initialize the state when we can pass callback function. this is called lazy evaluation.
- the callback function will be called only on initial render, function has to be pure and accept no arguments.

## Added
- we will store the watched movies to localStorage using useEffect, which will retain the state on refresh.
