## ContextAPI

#### Pros

- Built into react
- Easy to setup single context

#### cons

- Additional state (slice) requires additional providers from scratch, which can result in `Provider Hell`
- No mechanism for `async` operations
- `performance optimization` is pain
- only react devtools support.

## Redux

#### cons

- Requires additional packages
- More work at initial setup

### Pros

- after setup, `easy` to add additional State (`slice`)
- has `middleware` for async operations. (should not use this mechanism for remote state )
- `performance` is optimized on `out of the box`
- Excellent devtools.


## When to use what ?? 

### ContextAPI
- global state management for small apps
- When we need to share a value that doesn't change often like theme-color, auth info etc
- when we need to solve `prop drilling` issue
- when we need to manage state in `local sub tree` of the app.

### Redux 
- manage global state for large apps
- when we have lot of global UI state that updated frequently.
- when we have complex state like nested objects and arrays.
