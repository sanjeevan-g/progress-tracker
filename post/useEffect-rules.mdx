## useEffect Rules and Best Practices

### Dependency Array 
- every `state` value, `prop`, `context value` used inside the useEffect must be added in dependency array
- must include `reactive values` i.e `variables` or `functions` that reference any other reactive values.
    - function that uses state or props or context etc
    - derived states etc
- use `eslint` to check for missing dependencies.
- use `useMemo` or `useCallback` to cache the dependencies, if they are reference values like object or function.
- If we need to include multiple reactive elements that are releated to one another, we can use `useReducer` hook
- `setState` and `dispatch` functions are still the same on each render, no need to include in dependency array.
