## memo

- on state update, all the child components will re-render, if we don't want to re-render lagy component again and again,
- then we can memoize the child components with `memo`

```jsx
const LazyComponent = memo(function LazyComponent() {
  return <>...</>;
});
```

## useCallback and useMemo

- memoize values with `useMemo` and functions with `useCallback`
- both have dependency arrays

### useMemo
- it takes a `function` and store the result of the function in cache
- when dependency array values changes, function will be re executed and new value will be cached

### useCallback
- similar to `useMemo` but it will cache the function.

## usecases:
- memoize the props to avoid waste render ( with memo the component)
- memo value of expensive calculations
- memomize value of dependency array of another hook to avoid infinite loop
