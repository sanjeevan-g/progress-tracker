## How Events work in Browser ?

when we click a button, new `Event` object is created in `root of the DOM tree`, not in the target, then the event will travel from `root` to `target`
through the DOM nodes this is called `capture phase` after it reached the target, it will `travel back to the root` of the DOM.
this process is called `Bubbling phase`.

## How Events differ in react ?

In react, instead of `native` event object, `synthetic` event object is created. synthetic event is a thin `wrapper` around the native event.
it works constant in all browsers.

In synthetic events, to stop event propagation, we need to call `e.preventDefault()`.

to handle events at the `capture phase` add `Capture` at the evnt of the event i.e `onClickCapture()`.

Most synthetic events bubble exept `scroll`.

events like 'focus', 'blur', 'change' bubbles in react, which are not in native events.

## Facts:

- in react, event listeners are added to `root` of the application (interally), and react maps what function to call when event occurs.
