## When will a component re render ?

1. on state change
2. on subscribed context change
3. on parent state change

`on props change react component will not be re rendered`

## Our Issue

```jsx
export default function Test() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Slow counter?!?</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Increase: {count}</button>
      <SlowComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- `SlowComponent` is a stand-alone component with huge amount of data to be rendered
- it will be re rendered on each state update as it is a child component.

## Optimization
```jsx
const Counter = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Slow counter?!?</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Increase: {count}</button>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default function Test() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter>
        {/* here slowComponent is passes as prop so it won't be re-rendered on counter comp re-render */}
        <SlowComponent />
      </Counter>
    </div>
  );
}
```
1. Try to pass this SlowComponent as children or prop to the state component.
2. At the time of creating `Counter`, `SlowComponent` is also been created and passed as prop
3. Since it is a prop, on re-render it won't be re-rendered
4. But on `Test` component re-render, `SlowComponent` is also re-rendered again.
