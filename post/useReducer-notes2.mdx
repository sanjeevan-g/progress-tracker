## Mental Modal behind useReducer

useState is like directly updating the state.

for useReducer: we will pass action object to reducer function using `dispatch` method,
then reducer will decide how to update the state.

## When to use useReducer instead of useState

- when we have to do complex state updates

- when one state update will trigger many other state updates

- when we need other state values to calculate state values.
