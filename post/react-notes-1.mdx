## Functional Components

1. function `name` starts with `Caps` and need to return `null || markup (JSX)`
2. each function should return only one element i.e one parent element only, we can use `<></>` to wrap more elements
3. `Not to` declare new Functional Component inside another Functional Component.

## Function as reference

1. on rerender new function reference is created for all functions, so if we passing the function as props then we have to cache it before passing for performance reasons

## props

1. we can pass anyting as props from string to react components to child components in react similar to Javascript
2. props are data from `parent component` and we should not update the props in child component `(Read only)`
3. components are `pure function` in terms of props and state. when function updates data which are not inside the function is called `sideEffects`.
4. function should not update the data outside of the function, not even the variables outside the function.

```jsx
let a = 9;
function App() {
  a = 100; // we can't update the data outside of the function
  // it is a side effect
  return <h1>Number {a}</h1>;
}
// wrong approach
```

## conditional rendering

1. when using short circuiting ` ( expression && JSX ) ` use `boolean` values in expression, if it is an falsy value other then boolean, then that value will be rendered

```jsx
let a = 0;
{ a && <p> i will not be rendered </p>  }

// output: 0
```
here `a` is a falsy value so that  the falsy value will be retured from this short-circuit. else go with `ternary operator ( expression ? <true part> : <false part>) `

## Javascript Mode { }

1. inside `{ }` Javascript mode in jsx, we have to use only expression that will be computed to a result, we can't use `statements` like if-else statements inside javascript mode
