## Two types of logic in React

1. Render logic

   - code that lives in top level of the component
   - helps in describing how component view looks like
   - will be executed each time the component is rendered
     -Eg: `return of App.jsx`, variables that holds data etc.

2. Event handling logic
   - Executed as consequence of the event that handler is listening to like click, keypress, etc.
   - code that performs things like state updates, fetch data, navigation etc.

## Rules for Render Logic:

- components must be pure i.e when we give same props then the component instance must return same result.

- Render Logic must not produce any side effects like
  1. network request
  2. setting timers
  3. using DOM api directly like addEventListeners, etc.
  4. update state or ref, it will cause infinite loop
  5. mutating data that are outside the function scope like props etc.
