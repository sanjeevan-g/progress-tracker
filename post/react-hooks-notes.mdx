## What are hooks ?

hooks are special functions or api's that exposes React internals

- creating and accessing state from React
- registering `sideEffects` in React.

All hooks starts with `use` keyword.

With `custom-hooks` we can now reuse non-visual logics.

## Rules of hooks
- Call hooks only at top level
  - don't call inside conditions, loops etc
  - hooks should be called in same order
- call hooks only inside `Functional` components.

## Hooks rely on call order:
- React `Fiber` holds list of hooks used, this list is an `linkedList` with initialized order.
- Since it's a linkedlist, one hook is attached to the end to another hook
- if we initialize hook inside condition then on next re-render it may break the linkedlist order
