## Bundle

- Initially server will sent a single javascript file (`Bundle`) to the browser that contains entire application code.

- The application will execute only after the code get downloaded.

- If the bundle size is large, then it will take more time for the application to start in the browser.

## Code splitting

- Instead of sending whole bundle file, we can split the code into smaller juncks and send the files to the browser if required.

- this lazy loading will optimize the loading time in the browser

## Code splitting in React

```jsx
// import Product from "./pages/Product";

const Product = lazy(() => import("./pages/Product"));

<Suspense fallback={<SpinnerFullPage />}>
  <Product />
</Suspense>;
```

- Instead of normal import, use `dynamic import` using `lazy` function in react.
- lazy will return a promise, which will be resolved when the component rendered for the first time.
- wrap the component with `Suspense with fallback`.
