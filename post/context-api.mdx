## Context Api 
- System to pass data throughout the app with out manually passing props
- helps to `broadcast` global state to all child components
    - `provider` - give child components access to value
    - `value` - data we need to available, could be state or functions
    - `consumers` - child components which are subscribed to providers

- on value change, all consumers are notified and re-rendered
