## Routing
- render components based on url
- it is necessary to to have routing in large SPA
- routing is done using JavaScript so our page is not hard loaded

## SPA
- client side application 
- different URL's corresponds to different views (components)
- JavaScript (React) is used to update the page (DOM)
- page is never reloaded
- additional data can be fetched from external web api
- SPA feels like native app 

## Udemy worldwise
