## Why not to update DOM directly when state changes ?

Updating DOM is not cheap and it is slow and usually only few parts of the DOM has to be updated.

By use `reconciliation` react reuses existing DOM as much as possible.

## Reconciliation

Deciding which DOM elements needs to be updated, inserted, or deleted in order to keep DOM sync with state changes.

current Reconciler is called `Fiber`.

## React Fiber

After initializing react takes react.element tree (virtual DOM) and create Fiber Tree. each DOM OR Element represents a Fiber.
Unlike virtual DOM, Fiber tree is `created only once at initail render` and get mutated over and over again. Which makes perfect place to store 
component state, props, side-effects, used hooks etc.

In Fiber Tree, each `first child is linked` to is parent and all other `siblings have link to their previous sibling.` like a `linked list`.

React Reconciliation is `asynchronous` which means react can render in chunks and can prioritize the import part first.
It helps to `avoid Blocking of Browser Engine` while rendering large chunk.

## Reconciliation + Diffing

When state updates, react creates `new Virtual DOM`, now in Reconciliation process, react checks which part of the DOM need to be updated, inserted or deleted.
If element is re-rendered because of parent state change, corresponding Fiber node is not updated. as result react will g`enerate list of DOM updates.`

## Updating DOM

Updating DOM happens in `commit phase`

- `ReactDOM` is responsible for updating the DOM
- It is synchronous, all DOM updates are done is single go, it can't be interrupted
- After commmit phase complete, `updated Fiber (workInProgress)` become the `current Fiber tree` for next render cycle.
