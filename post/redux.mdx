## What is Redux ?

- 3rd party library to manage global state
- Standalone library, but easy to integrate with react.
- State are stored in one `global store` and can be updated using `actions` similar to useReducer.
- It is conceptually similar to context api + useReducer.
- There are 2 version of redux
  1. classic redux
  2. Redux Toolkit

## When to use Redux

- only when the `global state` updates more frequently.

## Machanism of redux:

1. The `event handler` will call the `action creator function`
2. `action creator function` will creation action for us.
3. the action will be passes to `dispatch function`
4. the dispatch function will call the correct reducer in global store
   - global store is where the `state` is stored, it has `multiple reducers` for each states.
5. after state update, the `component subscribed` to the state will `re-render`.
