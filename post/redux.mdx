- 3rd party library to manage global state
- Standalone library, but easy to integrate with react.
- State are stored in one `global store` and can be updated using `actions` similar to useReducer.
- It is conceptually similar to context api + useReducer.
- There are 2 version of redux
  1. classic redux
  2. Redux Toolkit

## When to use Redux 
- only when the `global state` updates more frequently.
