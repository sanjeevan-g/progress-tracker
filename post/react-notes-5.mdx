## State Bashing
In react, state updates are `asynchronous` and the updates are bashed together.

- react will not be re-rendered again and again for multiple state updates happening in the same time or in same function (event handler function).
- updated state value are `available` only after `rerender` not on after calling `setState`
- if we need updated state value then pass `callback fn` to the setState function.
- setState function can be called inside `event handler, timerFn, promise etc` this all are bashed together.
- when setting same state value again will not trigger rerender, react avoid updating state value as optimization.
