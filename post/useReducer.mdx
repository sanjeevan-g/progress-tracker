## useReducer

it is similar to useState for managing the state, but in complex way.

useReducer hook accepts 2 arguments, reducer function and initial state.

## Code

```jsx

import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...

```

## Reducer

- in `reducer` function we will specify how to compute new state.
- it accepts cur state and action
- action is the data we pass through dispatch function

## Dispatch

- to update the state we call `dispatch` function
- it accepts data which will be passes as `action` argument in reducer function.
- action data could be of any type
- common form of action is ```{type: 'string', payload: 'data'}```
