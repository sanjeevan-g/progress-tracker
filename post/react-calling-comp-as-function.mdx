In react, Functional component are `function` which returns `jsx`.

So can we call this component as function instead of React.createElement `(<Comp />)` ??

When we call the component as tags, then react attach  the `states and lifecycle methods` to the component.

on calling as function, then only the `jsx retured got rendered` with no state and lifecycle methods.
