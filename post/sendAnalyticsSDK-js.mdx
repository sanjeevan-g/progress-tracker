Implement an analytics SDK that exposes log events, it takes in events and queues them, and then starts sending the events

- Send each event after a delay of 1 second and this logging fails every n % 5 times.
- Send the next event only after the previous one resolves.
- When the failure occurs attempt a retry.

## initial code

```js
Input:
const sdk = new SDK();

sdk.logEvent("event 1");
sdk.logEvent("event 2");
sdk.logEvent("event 3");
sdk.logEvent("event 4");
sdk.logEvent("event 5");
sdk.logEvent("event 6");
sdk.logEvent("event 7");
sdk.logEvent("event 8");
sdk.logEvent("event 9");
sdk.logEvent("event 10");

sdk.sendAnalytics();

Output:
"Analytics sent event 1"
"Analytics sent event 2"
"Analytics sent event 3"
"Analytics sent event 4"
"-----------------------"
"Failed to send event 5"
"Retrying sending event 5"
"-----------------------"
"Analytics sent event 5"
"Analytics sent event 6"
"Analytics sent event 7"
"Analytics sent event 8"
"-----------------------"
"Failed to send event 9"
"Retrying sending event 9"
"-----------------------"
"Analytics sent event 9"
"Analytics sent event 10"
```

## final code

```js
/*
    Problem Statement
    Write an analytics SDK that exposes logEvent, it takes in analytics events and queues them
    - pass a function sendAnalyticsEvent as a parameter(implement a stub function that resolves in 1 second and fails every n%10 times)
    - send the next event to sendAnalyticsEvent when only after it resolves
    - when the failure occurs attempt a retry
*/

// create SDK function|class that has logEvent method, that add events to the queue
// then have send Analytics function that calls the event from the queue

const SDK = function () {
  this.queue = []; // store log event
  this.count = 1; // count of no of event passed in to sendAnalyticsEvent function

  this.logEvent = function (event) {
    this.queue.push(event);
  };

  // stub function will resolve in 1 sec and reject in this.count % 5 times
  this.wait = () =>
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (this.count % 5 === 0) reject();
        else resolve();
      }, 1000);
    });

  // this will be a recursive call
  this.sendAnalytics = async function () {
    if (this.queue.length === 0) {
      return;
    }

    let currentEvent = this.queue.shift();
    try {
      await this.wait();
      console.log("Analytics sent event", currentEvent);
      this.count++;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("-----------------------");
      console.log("Failed to send event", currentEvent);
      console.log("Retrying sending event ", currentEvent);
      console.log("-----------------------");
      this.queue.unshift(currentEvent); // put back the current event
      this.count = 1; // reset the count
    } finally {
      this.sendAnalytics();
    }
  };
};
```
