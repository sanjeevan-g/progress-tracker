## How to split up the Component

We should not use `Huge Single` component which will receive many props to work or very small components
which will end up with many component and hard to understand

So find balance between them.

Component should be

- Logical Seperation
- Some are reusable
- low complexity with responsability

## Component Category

1. stateless or presentation component

- has no state
- usually small components
- can receive props and present those data and other contents

2. Stateful Component

- has state
- can be reusable

3. Structural Component

- pages, layouts and screens
- composed of many components
- Can be huge and non-reusable components

## Component Composition

Component Composition means combining components by using `children` props
It makes the components highly reusable.
It is like creatiing a template with slots, and any other components can be placed inside that slots.

## React Elements

React elements are the immutable object that React keeps in memory. this elements are then get comverted into `DOM Elements`
