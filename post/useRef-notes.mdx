## useRefs

- useRef holds mutable data which won't trigger re-render
- data are available in `.current` property
- we should not `read or write` the data in render logic or during rerendering
- it persists data accross re-renders
- updating refs are `synchronous` so we can read updated data soon after the value change.

## Active Element

- document.activeElement will return element which `currently in focus`.
