## What is Closure ?

function that has access to parent scope variables even after the parent function is executed or returned.

## closure in useEffect:

in useEffect, useCallback or useMemo, the function will have access to props or state or any reactive elements at the time
of init or creation. i.e the function will refer that particular value `previous snapshot or stale value`.

so thats why we use dependency array to recreate or re-initialize the function if any reactive value updates.
