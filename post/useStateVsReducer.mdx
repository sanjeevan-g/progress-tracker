| ideal for single, independent states like string,number,arrays                                                       | ideal for complex and related pieces of state like nested objects etc                           |
| logic to update the state is placed directly inside event handlers or effects and spread over one or more components | logic to update the state lives in one single place, decoupled from components called `reducer` |
| state is updated by calling setState                                                                                 | state is updated by dispatching action to reducer                                               |
| imperative state updates                                                                                             | more declarative state updates passing relavent action type to reducer                          |
| easy to understand                                                                                                   | bit complex to understand                                                                       |

## when to use useReducer

- just one piece of state -> (no) -> useReducer
- Do state frequently update together -> (yes) -> (willing to write slightly more complex code ) (yes) -> useReducer
- Over 3 or 4 pieces of state including objects
- Too many event handlers make components large and complicated
