## What is Compound Components ?
we will create a set of `related` components, combined together to form a big larger components.
like select component with options, select component.

## Why ?
these Patterns give more flexibility in determine the component order etc. so we don't need to pass `props` to make changes in component placements or styling
we can style or modify each inner (or) smaller components individually.

## Internal Working:
these related component have access to common state, we use `context API` for that.

steps:
- create a context
- create the parent component
- create child components 
- make the child component as property for main Parent component
