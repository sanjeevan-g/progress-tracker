## Symbol

Symbols are a primitive data type in JavaScript, like number, boolean, or null.
They're often used to avoid property name conflicts, or to simulate private values on JavaScript objects.

Symbol always provides unqiue values. if they are used a obj property then they are excluded from iteration
which make that obj\[Symbol\(key\)\] as private

## What is function currying

curry function will accepts a callback function and returns another function utill it gets all its arguments. after that it return the callback function result.

using function currying we can pass arguments is multiple ways.

```js
let curryFn = curry(fn);
curryFn(1)(2)(3)
curryFn(1)(2)()(3)
curryFn(1,2)(3)
...
```

## currying with placeholder support.

`placeholder` here placeholder is a special `symbol` we pass in place of arguments and later arguments will replace this placeholder with actual value.

```js
curriedJoin(_, 2)(1, 3);
// above will be considered as
curriedJoin(1, 2)(3);
```

in first argument we passed `_` it will be replace by `1` from next batch of arguments.

`in some cases placeholders are replaced by another placeholder`

```js
curriedJoin(_, _, _)(1)(_, 3)(2);
// here 1 will be placed in 1 argument
curriedJoin(1, _, _)(_, 3)(2);
// now 2nd spot `_` is replaced by next argument 1st spot `_`,
// and 3rd spot `_` is replaced by next argument 2nd spot 3
curriedJoin(1, _, 3)(2);
// now 2nd spot `_` is replaced by next argument 1st spot 2
curriedJoin(1, 2, 3);
```

## init code

```js
curry.placeholder = Symbol();

const join = (a, b, c) => {
  return `${a}_${b}_${c}`;
};

const curriedJoin = curry(join);
const _ = curry.placeholder;

console.log(curriedJoin(1, 2, 3)); // '1_2_3'

console.log(curriedJoin(_, 2)(1, 3)); // '1_2_3'

console.log(curriedJoin(_, _, _)(1)(_, 3)(2)); // '1_2_3'
```

## Currying code

```js
function curry(fn) {
  // your code here
  // similar to prev code

  return function curried(...args) {
    // check if we reached args limit and there is no placeholder
    let complete =
      args.length >= fn.length &&
      !args.slice(0, fn.length).includes(curry.placeholder);

    if (complete) {
      return fn(...args);
    }
    // return another fn that accepts new args and call curried again

    return function (...newArgs) {
      // replace placeholders in old args with new args
      let res = args.map((arg) => {
        if (arg === curry.placeholder) {
          if (newArgs.length) return newArgs.shift();
          else return arg;
        }
        return arg;
      });

      return curried(...res, ...newArgs);
    };
  };
}

curry.placeholder = Symbol();

const join = (a, b, c) => {
  return `${a}_${b}_${c}`;
};

const curriedJoin = curry(join);
const _ = curry.placeholder;

console.log(curriedJoin(1, 2, 3)); // '1_2_3'

console.log(curriedJoin(_, 2)(1, 3)); // '1_2_3'

console.log(curriedJoin(_, _, _)(1)(_, 3)(2)); // '1_2_3'
```

1. curry(fn) accepts the callback function and return another function `curried`

2. `curried` accepts arguments, if arguments are completed i.e got required amount of arguments and there is `no placeholder` in arguments then return `fn(...args)`

3. Else it will return another function to accepts the arguments and call the curried with old and new arguments after processing.

4. we will processing the old arguments by replacing the placeholder with new items in the new arguments.

5. after that pass the old and new arguments to curried fn and `repeats step2 again`.
