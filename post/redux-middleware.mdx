## How to do Asynchronous calls in Redux ?

- we can't do data fectching in store, since reducers are pure functions
- we can use useEffect to fetch data at component level and dispatch the data to store
  but it is not the right way
- we will use Middleware to handle this sideeffect

## Middleware

- middleware is a function that sit between dispatch and the store (reducer)
- after the dispatch, middleware get called then the store's reducer function will be called.
- we will use `thirdParty library` called `thunks` as middleware.
- with the middlewares, data fectching and data convertion are not present `component level`
- this actions are encapsulated in the `actionCreator or thunk` functions.

## steps to use middleware

- install
- apply middleware to the store
  - `const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));`
- use the middleware

## Thunk

- In `Action Creator` fn if we return obj, then it will directly dispatch the object.
- If it is function then it is a `thunk` function.

```js
return (dispatch, getState) => {
  // logic here that can dispatch actions or read state
};
```

- thunk function can we async too
- thunk function has access to dispatch and getState functions
- after sideeffect (data compute), we can call dispatch function to update the store
- Inside thunk, we can `call dispatch` function `multiple times` to set different states.

```js
export function deposit(amount, currency) {
  /* 
    if currency is usd no action needed, return action object
    */
  if (currency === "USD") return { type: "account/deposit", payload: amount };

  // else use thunk, return thunk function
  return async function (dispatch, getState) {
    // set isloading true
    dispatch({
      type: "account/convertingCurrency",
    });

    const res = await fetch(
      `https://${host}/latest?amount=${amount}&from=${currency}&to=USD`
    );
    const data = await res.json();

    const convertedAmount = data.rates.USD;
    dispatch({ type: "account/deposit", payload: convertedAmount });
  };
}
```
