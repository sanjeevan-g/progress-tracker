we have to create `faraway` project, in that we can add items we need to for trip.

we can also ckeck, whether we packed those items or not.

##Todo:

- ~create header, form to add items, items list and footer~
- ~show items in list~ 
- ~add new items using form and controlled components~
- ~create state to hold the items in App components~
- ~toggle the items when they are packed.~
- ~update footer to show `what % of items are packed`~
