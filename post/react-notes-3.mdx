## How components are rendered in react

### Step 1: Render is triggered

Re-render is triggered when state changes internally.

There are 2 scenarios that triggers render:
1. initial render of the application.
2. State Updates (re-render)

#### Note:
- when state updates in one component, all of its children are called with component methods (render phase).
- Renders are not triggered immediately.but scheduled by JS engine when it has 'free time' usually in ` miliseconds`

### Step 2: Render Phase

In this phase react calls component methods like lifecycle methods etc to figure out how to update the DOM.
In this phase `DOM is not updated`, `Rendering is not about updating DOM or creating elements`,
rendering happens only `inside the react internally`.

1. initially React will create a `virtual DOM` which is nothing but `JS object tree of React Elements`.
2. At rerender, React will take all the React Elements that triggered `rerender` and then `create new React Elements`.
 this process is simple in nature, bacause Virtual DOM is just `JS Object`. 
3. This `new Virtual DOM` along with current `React Fiber` are given as inputs to `Reconciler + diffing algo` which return `updated Fiber Tree`

### Step 3: Commit

After knowing how to update the DOM, Actual `DOM Updates` like 'create','delete', `update` happens in this phase.

### Step 4: Browser Re-paints ( Done by browser, it is nothing to do with react)

After knowing DOM is been updated, browser re-paints the screen.
